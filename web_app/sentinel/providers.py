"""LLM provider plumbing for Sentinel.

Sentinel asks an LLM to do four distinct things during a run:

  - ``agent``        choose the next browser action (multimodal, dynamic system prompt)
  - ``final_report`` write the markdown report at the end of a run
  - ``title``        generate a short run title
  - ``verdict``      decide whether the run actually fulfilled the user's prompt

Each of those is a *role*. A *transport* is the wire-level mechanism for
talking to a particular backend (Codex CLI, Meridian HTTP, AWS Bedrock).
``_Provider`` glues the two together: you ask it for ``role X`` and it
dispatches to the active transport with the role's system prompt,
max_tokens, and timeout.
