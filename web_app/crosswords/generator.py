"""
Simple crossword grid builder.

Given a pool of (word, clue) pairs this produces a compact grid with
standard Across/Down clue numbering. The algorithm is intentionally
small - good enough for hand-picked word pools of ~10-15 entries.

Output format is JSON-serialisable and consumed directly by the
template/JS:

    {
        "rows": int,
        "cols": int,
        "cells": [[ {"letter": str, "number": int|None} | None, ... ], ...],
        "clues": {
            "across": [{"number": int, "clue": str, "answer": str,
                        "row": int, "col": int, "length": int}, ...],
            "down":   [...],
        },
    }

Cells that are not part of any entry are `None` (rendered as black).
